This means that most of the code will need to live in a different branch. The master branch will get nuked at every deploy so don't store any files in the master branch. Generate the site using your production settings: pelican content -o output -s publishconf.py To get published, replace the contents of the master branch with the contents of the output directory. Run pip install ghp - import to install the utility that will make this easy. Then from the source branch run: ghp - import - b master output This will have the effect of removing all the contents of master, then copying the contents of output/ to master. The last step will be to push this changes to Github: git push origin master Hopefully you now have a basic site running.","tags":"Blog","loc":"souaaz/blog/Install Pelican on GitHub.html","title":"Install Pelican on GitHub"}]}
