This means that most of the code will need to live in a different branch. The most important point is that the master branch will get nuked at every deploy so don't store any files in the master branch. The next thing to do is generate the site using your production settings: pelican content -o output -s publishconf.py Finally, this has to get published by replacing the contents of the master branch with the contents of the output directory. Run pip install ghp - import to install the utility that will make this easy. Then from the source branch run: ghp - import - b master output This will have the effect of nuking the contents of master then copying the contents of output/ to master. The last step will be to push this changes to Github: git push origin master Hopefully you now have a basic site running. There are many Pelican blogs out there.","tags":"Tools","loc":"souaaz.github.io/tools/Install Pelican on GitHub.html","title":"Install Pelican on GitHub"}]}
